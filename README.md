# Simple Socket Programming in Python

This repository contains a basic client-server socket programming example implemented in Python. This example demonstrates how to create a simple server that listens for incoming connections and a client that connects to the server and exchanges messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Instructions

### Server

1. Run the server script `server.py`.
2. The server will start and wait for incoming connections.
3. Once a client connects, the server will send a message to the client and wait for a response.
4. After receiving a response from the client, the server will print it and close the connection.

### Client

1. Run the client script `client.py`.
2. The client will connect to the server.
3. Upon connection, the client will receive a message from the server and print it.
4. The client will then send a message to the server.
5. After sending the message, the client will close the connection.

## Files

- `server.py`: Python script implementing the server.
- `client.py`: Python script implementing the client.

## Usage

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/socket-programming-python.git`
- Navigate to the repository directory: `cd socket-programming-python`
- Follow the instructions above to run the server and client.

## Notes

- The server and client communicate over the loopback address (`localhost`) using a specific port (default port 12345). You can modify the host and port as needed in the scripts.
- This is a basic example meant for educational purposes. In real-world applications, you would need to add error handling, implement data serialization, and consider security measures.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your needs!
